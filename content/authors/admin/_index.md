I am a 4th year PhD Student at the [Computer Vision Laboratory](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/isy/cvl) at Linköping university under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Felsberg](https://liu.se/en/employee/micfe03). My main focus is sparsity and uncertainty-aware deep learning for sparse and noisy data such as LiDAR, optical flow fields, and RGB-D.

I obtained my masters' degree in 2016 in Communication and Information Technology from [Nile University](https://nu.edu.eg/), Egypt . My master thesis title was "“The AERIAL tracker: A Robust Visual Tracker for Miro-Drones”. I obtained my BSc degree with honors in 2011 in Computers and Systems Engineering from [Mansoura University](http://www.mans.edu.eg/en/), Egypt.
